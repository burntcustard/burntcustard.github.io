## [backdrop-filter](#backdrop-filter)

Two words: Frosted. Glass.

The [backdrop-filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) property lets you apply a filter to an area _behind_ an element. The most obvious example is `backdrop-filter: blur()`, which lets you make iOS-style dialogs boxes, overlays, buttons, etc.

You can use any of the CSS [\<filter-functions\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function) as values for backdrop-filter. Another helpful one is `invert()`, as it can make <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> elements like crosshairs stand out on any background.

`backdrop-filter` recently landed in Firefox 103, so it's now in all moderns browsers. The `-webkit-` prefix is still needed for Safari, but I'd recomend leaving that off for js13kGames, as Firefox + Chromium is enough, and loosing the effect likely isn't a game-breaking bug for Safari users.
