{% codepen_js %}

There are only a handful of [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) entries each year that use CSS, but there have been tons of usful <small>(yes, for games!)</small> additions to the language over the last year. Hopefully me pointing some of them out can get more people interested!

## [accent-color](#accent-color)

Starting off simple, [accent-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color) sets the color for UI controls like checkboxes and range sliders. Safari added it in version 15.4 (March 2022), so there's now full browser support ðŸ¥³ There's a great [article on it by web.dev](https://web.dev/accent-color/) if you want to know more.

## [backdrop-filter](#backdrop-filter)

Two words: Frosted. Glass.

The [backdrop-filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) property applies a filter to an area _behind_ an element. The most obvious example is `backdrop-filter: blur()` for iOS-style dialogs boxes, overlays, buttons, etc.

{% codepen "https://codepen.io/burntcustard/pen/qBoMeQg" "preview:false;tabs:css,result" %}

You can use any of the CSS [\<filter-functions\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function) as values for backdrop-filter. Another helpful filter is `invert()`, as it can make <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> elements like crosshairs stand out on any background.

A rudimentary tilt-shift effect can be created by combining a mask with `backdrop-filter: blur()`.

First, the mask-image. We're going to use the [mask shorthand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask), and it needs the `-webkit-` prefix as browsers are being slow at implementing it sans-prefix, but even Firefox supports it.

This mask starts at the top as black (any color _should_ work, checking if `red` can save a couple of byes is on my todo listâ€¦) to apply the full filter effect, then fades to transparent so that towards the center the view the filter isn't applied

```
-webkit-mask: linear-gradient(black 10%, transparent 40% 60%, black 90%);
```

The `.filter` element must have some sort of background for the mask to be applied - so here we give it `background: #0ff;`

{% codepen "https://codepen.io/burntcustard/pen/jOzerZg" "preview:false;tabs:css,result" %}

We can then swap out the background for a `backdrop-filter` - this one blurs slightly, and darkens and desatures with < 1 values.

```
backdrop-filter: blur(5px) brightness(0.8) grayscale(0.2);
```

This CSS-based city uses the effect to [miniture-ify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_faking) it:

`backdrop-filter` recently landed in Firefox 103, so it's now in all moderns browsers. The `-webkit-` prefix is still needed for Safari, but I'd recomend leaving that off for js13kGames, as losing the effect likely isn't a game-breaking bug.

## inset

## clamp()
